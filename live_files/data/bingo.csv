Classrooms today look like classrooms one hundred years ago,We have 21st century learners and need 21st century…,Teachers are digital immigrants,Traditional teaching and traditional teachers are bad,Your phone can put your learners on Uranus
We are preparing learners for a future that we have no idea about,Teachers who use technology will replace those who don’t,Trope is the new trope,ELT is one of the institutions most deserving of disruption,A fool with a tool is still a fool
A teacher needs to be more a guide by the side than the sage on the stage,Any teacher that can be replaced by a computer should be,The language school needs to be re-schooled,Language schools will be wiped from the pages of history,Make apps make money
Click three times a fairy godmother will logon & grant your wishes,Embrace the eduction-industrial complex,It is up to language teachers themselves to upgrade their skills,Choas is the only learning theory in town,Let language learners personalize so they can get ahead
The young learner digital natives are getting restless,Let learners cash in on the hole in the walls,If they can't learn it in 140 letters go home,If they are not smiling they are not learning, If you are not smiling you are a neolib conspiracy nut
