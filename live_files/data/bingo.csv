Classrooms today look like classrooms one hundred years ago,We have 21st century learners and need 21st century…,Teachers are digital immigrants,Traditional teaching and traditional teachers are bad,You have the same amount of technology on your phone that put a man on the moon
We are preparing learners for a future that we have no idea about,Teachers who use technology will replace those who don’t,Trope is the new trope,ELT is one of the institutions most deserving of disruption,It’s a tool like any other teaching tool and like any other teaching tool it’s what you do with it that counts
A teacher needs to be more a guide by the side than the sage on the stage,Any teacher that can be replaced by a computer should be,The language school needs to be re-schooled,Language schools will be wiped from the pages of history,Make apps make money
Click three times and your fairy godmother will logon and grant your wishes,The education-industrial complex has been grooming your kids and they love it,It is up to language teachers themselves to upgrade their skills,Choatic learning theory makes the only sense in this chaotic life of ours,Let language learners personalize so they can get ahead
Young learners are digital natives and they are getting restless,In- appropriate applause,"""Let me be clear...""","""job-killing regulations""",Actual tax loophole named
